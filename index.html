                                David O’Quigley, or ‘Quigs’ as he is more commonly known, is a self-proclaimed maker: a
                                fixer-of things, an innovator of ideas. By all accounts Quigs is also an excellent
                                problem solver.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having observed most of the life lessons he’s been given, Quigs has gathered a unique
                                set of skills through various work opportunities and experiences as well as many
                                collaborations throughout the years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With an eclectic work background that ranges from managing a juggling shop to cycling
                                upwards of 80km a day as a cycle messenger in London, to his most recent venture:
                                programming Arduinos for art installations, Quigs’ skills have been steadily growing -
                                not to mention his ability to talk about himself in the third person.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The journey to better himself is ongoing and Quigs is now studying to become a Full
                                Stack Developer, a job that he knows he will excel in. He is excited to take what he
                                already knows and build on it in order to provide a unique perspective to his problem
                                solving.

                            With an eclectic work background it means I have been able to work across several different
                            fields, each requiring their own set of unique skills and problems to be solved. Here are
                            just some of the projects that have moulded me over the years.

                            <p>In 2015 myself and some friends entered a hackathon in London. Over the course of a
                                weekend we developed and built a proof of concept cycling product.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The experience was great, working with people from a broad spectrum of backgrounds we
                                were able to compliment each other’s skills perfectly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The end result was a first place winning wearable smart bike light that would
                                automatically indicate for the user while providing extra visibility for other road
                                users.

                            <p>
                                In the last few years I’ve developed my passion for micro-electronics and smart Internet
                                Of Things devices. These are basically just small, task-specific computers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I collaborated with an artist to produce Pagoda, a 14m tall hanging sculpture with over
                                45m of RGB LED lighting all of which was controlled by an Arduino Mega. The piece was
                                toured around a number of music festivals and ultimately seen by thousands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My role was to help realise the artists goal. I specified the various components that
                                would be needed, taking into consideration the power draw and computing needs and the
                                animations that were required. There was a bit of a learning curve as I hadn’t done
                                anything this big before not to mention the problems we dealt with while installing it
                                on site. This was a hugely rewarding project and has since opened many doors for me.

                                While in London I was lucky enough to work as a cycle messenger, arguably one of the
                                best jobs I have ever had. Being a lover of bikes anyway is probably key to helping
                                that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                LCEF, or London Courier Emergency Fund, was set up over a decade ago in order to help
                                support cycle couriers who were injured at work. Due to technically being self-employed
                                when a courier is injured at work that tends to stop their income.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For this project I used my skills as a videographer to produce this short piece
                                highlighting the importance of the LCEF and letting others know what it is they do. This
                                was a fun project to try my hand at filming while on a bike.
