## Creative Catalyst, something else and finally a third thing.

This website is to showcase the eclectic, wide ranging projects I have been lucky enogh to work on over the years. 
The website serves as a live CV, using past, current and planned projects to highlight the varios skillsets I have
and how I implement them to achieve, what I consider, interesting projects. As well as informative, I hope that 
the site is interesting, engaging and possibly even sparks some creativity in each viewer. My own path and varied careers
has not been what some might call the traditional way, so to reflect that this site has all the standard information
a CV would but it's laid out in a more interestin, user-friendly and entertaining way.
