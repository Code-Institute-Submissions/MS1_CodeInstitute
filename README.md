## Creative Catalyst, maker and learner.

This website is to showcase the eclectic, wide ranging projects I have been lucky enogh to work on over the years. 
The website serves as a live CV, using past, current and planned projects to highlight the varios skillsets I have
and how I implement them to achieve, what I consider, interesting projects. As well as informative, I hope that 
the site is interesting, engaging and possibly even sparks some creativity in each viewer. My own path and varied careers
has not been what some might call the traditional way, so to reflect that this site has all the standard information
a CV would but it's laid out in a more interestin, user-friendly and entertaining way.

### The business goals
+ to show off my skills to prospective employers and collabortors
+ let them know that I am open to commision based work.

### Target Audience
+ Other makers
+ small companies looking for an in-houes full stacker
+ Artists looking for technical help in realising their projects
+ Marketing and branding companies loooking for on site installations
+ ect

### User Goals
+ Learn about who I am and what I do
+ Understand that collaboration in realising a new idea is what I'm here for
+ Be inspired to create 


### User Stories - First Time Visitors
It's quite likey that most new users visiting this site will not understand fully what it is I do,
they may have been sent a link, or handed a business card at an event. It's for this reason I have taken
care to consider as many use cases as possible and tried to address them.

## Design

+ color 
  + Taking lead from the main photo, I chose to use white and dark greys, the teal blue was inspiration I took from a thermisat bottle I own.
  

+ Typography 
  + Although the Roboto font gets used a lot and I have indeed used it in the past there is an certain amount of "if it's not broken..." that comes with it.
  + I had intentionally wanted to use a paid font I have used in the past but I wasn't sure about the liscening for. It might be bit outside the scope of this project but as it's one of my favourite I'll certainly re-visit thsi issue.


## Wireframes

 I started with the classic pen and paper aproach with this. Have a look at the sketches [here](assets/images/ScreenShots/wireframe_mobile.jpg) and [here](assets/images/ScreenShots/wireframe_desktop.jpg) 

One of the main design features I was hoping to implement was the use of a continual theme, running through each of the sections. I had hoped to achieve this with the use of a stylised 'blockquote' at the top of each section. I later decided that it wasn't turning out as pleasing as I had thougth it might so I left them out


## Features
+ Responsive across all device types
+ contact form that works
+ easy to navigate

## Technologies Used
+ HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript were the core technologies used, the latter only for the navigation menu.
+ Github
  + This is where my project is hosted and version controll was used. It will be where 
  the site will live until enthropy is reversed.
+ Gitpod
  + Part of this project was coded in Gitpod and where Git was used for version control
+ VSCode
  + After running into some performance issues I switched to VSCode on the advice of some other students. Seamless transition, much better work flow.
+ Photoshop
  + I used photo shop to sample colours from images as well as to crop screen shots.
+ Handbrake
  + Handbrake is an open source application that I used to resize and optize photo's for the web.
+ Chrome Dev Tools
  + This is probably the most used tool. It was key in identify issues and rapidly prototyping solutions.
+ Favicon.io
  + I used this site to generate the favicon icon.
+ FontAwesome
  + Responsible for the social icons used in the navbar and footer as well as the caret for the 'back to top'
+ Google Fonts
  + Imported the two fonts used across the site
+ Bootstrap 4.3.1
  + I used Bootrtrap to form the majority of the layout, utilising their grid system and a few other Bootstrap classes.
+ Dummyimage.com
  + I used dummyimage.com when I was laying out the site. It's quite handy as their shorthand urls are easily configurable which means I don't have to spend time grabbing photos, I can type them in directly.


## Features Yet to Implement
There are a few things I would have liked to add to this site but didn't get a chance to for now but I would like to revisit at some stage.
 + As I mentioned above, I would have liked to have a running theme across the page, I'd like to spend more time trying to get that to look good.
+ In the Projects section I would like to have a 'read more' link where only the first few lines and thumbnail are shown offering the user a chance to click into an article if they wish. This would tidy up that section I think and allow for more articles to be placed in the page without adding too much clutter.



## Links and Resources
For this project I drew a lot on the previous walk-through projects on the course, where I got stumped and need external help I've listed below.

+ Bootstrap Documentation
  + I used this almost as much as the Chrome Dev Tools, reading and re-reading thier classes.

+ W3schools.com
  + Similarily I found the examples listed on this site to be incredibly helpful, in particular [this](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp) exact snippet of code was used to position the background images on this site.

+ Youtube
  + [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23bpce-5s8I&list=PL55RiY5tL51rLqH4-8LBVlUTIFF70dxhb&index=3&ab_channel=Academind) video was extremely helpful in understaning Bootsraps navbar.

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48735679/bootstrap-change-navbar-link-colors) Stackoverflow directed me on how to change the navbar-link colours.

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18133653/how-to-change-bootstrap-scrollspy-active-link-color) Stackoverflow comment helped me drilling down into the navbar active link colour.

+ [blockquote](https://codepen.io/cliftwalker/pen/XJaEXY)
  + I used this HTML and CSS to achieve the blockquote on my about section.

## Testing

I understand that testing is a huge part of the process of creating a page but unfortunately due to time restraints I wasn't able to conduct a suffienct and deep test. 

I was able to check with [Lighthouse](assets/images/ScreenShots/lighthouse.jpg) a few of the issues but once again I wasn't able to spend too much time fixing them.

### Known Bugs

+ favicon
  + Although I believe I have included everything needed for the favicon was not able to get it working. I suspect it is not a big issue and given more time would be easily fixed.

  ## Deployment

  ### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
